A function which compares two Javascript objects or arrays and determines whether or not they have an "identical structure".  An "identical structure" means:
       - All objects have the same keys
       - All values are of the same type
       - All arrays are the same length
       - All objects contained within arrays also have the same structure (although they may appear in a different order)
